# Lab2WebDev
---
This is a project to recreate the static website that we did in our first lab using **Python** and **Flask** as well as using **Jinja** to ensure that we reused as much of the *html* code as possible.
I have also rewritten my css code so that only one *css* file is needed instead of one for each page.
There is one *Javascript* file in this project which was used to create a slideshow for the pictures from each of the favourite games. The code is split up into a few different parts.
-The main folder contains the python code that will allow flask to create a server.
-The template folder contains all of the html files.
-The static folder contains the *css*, *Javascript* and images.
