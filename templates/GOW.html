                    <h2>What's good about the game?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The graphics of the game are really good quality<br>
                        It is also the first God of War game made for the ps4<br>
                        So there is a big improvement in graphics.<br>
                        The controls of the game are also really good and the combat and puzzles in<br>
                        the game are really engaging.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Why do I like the game?</h2>

                        <ol>
                            <li>It has really good characters and a good story</li>
                            <li>the combat is engaging</li>
                            <li>plenty of puzzles to break up combat</li>
                            <li>lots of items to collect so you can customise gear</li>
                            <li>difficult side content gives you something to work towards</li>
                            <li>longest God of War game and only one made specifically for the ps4</li>

                        From the reviews of the game that I could find online, both critics and players alike<br>
                        Seem to really enjoy this game.<br>
                        I think the main reason for this is the fact that this is the only <br>
                        God of War game that was made for the current gen of consoles<br>
                        so people were waiting for a while for a new game.<br>
                        I think a new setting in Norse mythology also helped the game<br>
                        To be liked more as it gave it a fresh feeling<br>
                        As the other games in the series all took place in Greek mythology.
