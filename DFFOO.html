                    <h2>What's good about the game?</h2>
                    <p>
                        It is a completely free to play game. The game also gives you a lot of resources as a free to play player<br>
                        So you don't have to feel like you have to pay money for the game to get all of the characters.<br>
                        They also give you a free month of one of the premium features that usually costs around â‚¬50.<br>
                        The gameplay is also engaging and you're able to play it for years without getting bored.<br>
                    </p>

                    <h2>Why do I like the game?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since it is a phone game, it is pretty easy to just start playing it whenever.<br>
                        I also like the game because it allows you to play characters from all of the <br>
                        Full Final Fantasy games together which I like since I've played a couple <br>
                        Of these games.<br>
                        There is also a pretty good community around the game which makes it easy to interact with other people.<br>
                    </p>

                    <h2>What do others think of the game?</h2>

                        </a>
                        <br>
                        According to the reviews on the google play store the game seems to be pretty well received.<br>
                        The main compliments for the game seem to be the fact that it is friendly towards free to play people <br>
                        And the fact that people are able to use characters from their favourite Final Fantasy games.<br>
                        The main complaints about the game seem to be about the game not loading properly or other bugs.
